Our goal is to acquire a functional understanding of the
deregulation of signalling networks in disease and to apply this
knowledge to develop novel therapeutics. We focus on cancer,
auto-immune and fibrotic disease. Towards this goal, we integrate
big (‘Omics’) data with mechanistic molecular knowledge into
statistical and machine learning methods, and we share our tools as
free open-source packages.

We are at the [Institute for Computational Biomedicine
(https://www.medizinische-fakultaet-hd.uni-heidelberg.de/einrichtungen/institute/institute-for-computational-biomedicine)
at the [Medical Faculty](http://www.medizinische-fakultaet-hd.uni-heidelberg.de/Home.2.0.html?L=en)
[Heidelberg University]https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en") and
[Heidelberg University Hospital](https://www.heidelberg-university-hospital.com/home/)
We are also part of
[the Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit (MMPU)](https://www.embl.de/mmpu/mmpu/research_groups/chronic_kidney_disease/index.html)
between the Medical Faculty of the University of Heidelberg and the
European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and of [ELLIS
Heidelberg](https://www.ellis-life-heidelberg.eu/).
