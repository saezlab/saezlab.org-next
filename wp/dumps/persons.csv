My scientific career started with an internship at the group of Dr. Dopazo, which drag me to the thrilling field of systems biology. During my time at Dopazo’s group, I successfully developed a system-level tool based on boolean approaches. PathiVar considers the expression pattern of different tissues to assess the impact of individual genomic variants in the ability of relevant signalling pathways to transmit their signals. As my interest for modeling was growing, I started questioning myself about how dynamical behaviours could influence our perception of biological systems. Thus, I decided to join Csikász-Nagy’s group to pursue my PhD in Computational Biology. My doctorate project was focused on developing minimal networks holding key biological behaviours, switches and timekeepers, with evolutive implications in the dynamics of well-know biological process as the circadian clocks and the eukaryotic cell cycle. In 2019, I joined Sáez-Rodríguez’s group at Heidelberg University (BioQuant) as a postdoctoral researcher to work on the European Project individualizePeaediatricCure (IPC).

Following this enthusiasm, in 2014 I decided to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Biology. Because I have always been a computer nerd, I was delighted when I "discovered" the field of Bioinformatics. It motivated me to start programming on my own, implementing algorithms from scratch or toying with data visualization methods. After my Bachelor's internship in a Computational Biology group, I enrolled in a two years Master in Bioinformatics for Health Sciences. For my Master's internship, I had the pleasure to work in Patrick Aloy's group developing the </span><a href="https://chemicalchecker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chemical Checker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a chemoinformatics resource of bioactivity signatures for small molecules. Specifically, my Master's thesis focused on the inference of bioactivity signatures for uncharacterized compounds and the automated generation of novel molecules optimized by a target bioactivity signature. This project allowed me to learn about the state of the art in deep learning algorithms and spurred me to learn more about the modeling of biological data. In September 2020 I started pursuing my PhD here in the Saez group.</span>\

I started working as a postdoctoral researcher at the Food Toxicology Research Center of the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRAE) in Toulouse, in a project funded by the French National Cancer Institute (INCA). Here I was in charge of developing new computational methods to understand metabolic dysregulations in cancer due to mutations in the p53 gene and also in key target genes, combining previous biological knowledge with experimental data. During these years, I gained extensive knowledge on mathematical modeling for metabolism, as well as linear and  discrete optimization. One of the things I realized is that many challenges cannot be solved without knowledge of signaling and regulatory networks, and vice versa. Moreover, many of the methodological problems in metabolic modeling are also shared in causal modeling of regulatory networks. I joined the Saez-Rodríguez group at Heidelberg University as a Postdoctoral Researcher with the aim of improving some of the current technical and methodological issues of the current methods for causal inference of signalling networks, in the context of the European project <i>PerMedCoE.</i> This project aims to improve current methods and prepare them for pre-exascale computing, enabling large-scale modeling using omics data for personalized medicine.

3806	1	2023-05-22 15:02:27	2023-05-22 13:02:27	My computational research career started during my Bachelor studies in Physics where I simulated particle decay properties upon hardware exchange at the ALICE experiment, CERN. During my subsequent Master studies, I majored in Medical Physics, co-developing a semi-automated image analysis pipeline for heavy ion radiotherapy experiments.\
\
Sparked by the heterogeneity in biological response upon radiotherapy, I decided to pursue a second, interdisciplinary Master degree in Radiation Biology to deepen my understanding in biological and medical aspects of cancer treatment.\
\
During my subsequent PhD, I combined wet and dry lab approaches to profile transcriptional, cellular, and phenotypic changes during metastasis formation in colorectal cancer and to shed light on the question as to why some metastasis grow in an uncontrolled manner, while others can stay dormant for years or even decades.\
\
Within my postdoctoral research, I am building on both wet- and dry lab background to integrate single-cell and spatially-resolved transcriptome data in glioblastoma multiforme.

3809	1	2023-05-30 15:29:32	2023-05-30 13:29:32	I started to study medicine in Strasbourg in 2017 before joining the MD-PhD program of the École Normale Supérieure and the University of Paris.\
\
I completed in 2021 a master in systems biology and bioinformatics. My master thesis was on the personalisation of disease boolean models using mutational and single-cell RNA data at Curie Institute.\
\
I then realised 2 additional internships, one on the use of multilayer networks to integrate and analyse multiomics data at the ENS of Paris, the second one on gene regulatory networks evaluation in Julio Saez-Rodriguez's group.\
\
I started my PhD in September co-supervised by Julio Saez-Rodriguez and Laura Cantini (Pasteur Institute, Paris), focusing on regulatory mechanisms inference at both intracellular and intercellular levels.

3812	1	2023-06-12 15:23:45	2023-06-12 13:23:45	I completed my Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry at Heinrich-Heine University in Düsseldorf and Michigan State University in the US. Throughout this period, I actively participated in various research endeavors primarily centered around the analysis and characterization of individual proteins. However, during my Master's program at Heidelberg University, my focus shifted towards investigating biological processes more holistically using large single-cell and spatial multi-omics data sets. In my Master's thesis, for example, I leveraged single-cell RNA and ATAC-seq data to infer and compare gene regulatory networks underlying the development of the mammalian cerebellum. Now I work on deciphering myeloid subtype diversity in multiple sclerosis supported by the DFG  Priority Programme “Local and Peripheral Drivers of Microglial Diversity and Function” (SPP 2395)	Philipp Schaefer		publish	closed	closed		philipp-schaefer			2023-06-13 12:19:27	2023-06-13 10:19:27		0	https://saezlab.org/?post_type=person&#038;p=3812	0	person		0
3817	1	2023-06-18 17:27:03	2023-06-18 15:27:03	I have always liked biology and medicine, so studying biochemistry for my undergrad was a good decision. My journey of liking computers so much started when I went to the CRUK-CI for a wet lab summer internship. I saw two interns next to me working on a super cool-looking computer screen. Since then, I have pursued computational knowledge constantly. During my master’s in Berlin, I again had both wet lab and dry lab experience, and realised that I am very passionate about computers (thank you Vim). During my master’s thesis at Stefanie Großwendt’s lab, I also realised that I am super interested in the topic of cell-cell communication, and in databases with biological prior knowledge. Therefore (and especially thanks to all my previous supervisors, colleagues, family and friends) I have decided to pursue academia further, joining the Saez-Rodriguez lab as a PhD student.

3879	1	2024-01-08 19:45:44	2024-01-08 18:45:44	In 2019, I received my BSc in Molecular Biomedicine in Bonn, Germany, and pursued my master studies in Molecular Biosciences in Heidelberg, Germany. During this time, I focused on computational biology in translational biomedical research. I explored the field of single-cell transcriptomics as well as various deconvolution methods of bulk RNA sequencing data. I interned and worked at the DKFZ Heidelberg and at ETH Zurich. In my master thesis with the Schapiro lab, I assessed different spatial neighborhood analysis methods using <i>in silico</i> generated tissue data.\
\
In my PhD, my goal is to decipher the spatial architecture of liver tumors using highly multiplexed imaging.\
\
I conduct my PhD with Dr. Denis Schapiro and am an associate member with Julio Saez-Rodriguez.	Chiara Schiller		publish	closed	closed		chiara-schiller			2024-01-08 19:45:44	2024-01-08 18:45:44		0	https://saezlab.org/?post_type=person&#038;p=3879	0	person		0
3888	1	2024-01-17 01:53:29	2024-01-17 00:53:29	I did my bachelor's degree in Biology at the Universidad de Guadalajara in Mexico. Back then I had joined a couple of wet-lab groups focused on molecular biology and immunology. After having the opportunity to do research in Germany, I started my M.Sc degree in Molecular Bioscience at Heidelberg University. While exploring my interests, at first, I carried out internships which had both wet-lab and dry-lab components, but then I fully transitioned to bioinformatics. The projects included high-throughput screens of regulatory sequences, tool development in the context of a TCR-epitope deconvolution platform for autoimmune diseases, and studying gene regulatory networks in the immune system using a multi-omics cell atlas. During this time, my interest on two areas only grew: i) the immune system and its impact on disease mechanisms, and ii) tool development and data analysis to better understand biology. I will focus on both of these areas during my PhD at the Saez-Rodriguez group. I will explore IgA nephropathy by analyzing multi-omics datasets and will also dedicate my time to the prior-knowledge tools developed by the group.
