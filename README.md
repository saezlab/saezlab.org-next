# New saezlab.org

This is an [Astro](https://astro.build/) implementation of our group web site
[saezlab.org](https://saezlab.org).

## How does it work?

This site is automatically built by [this action](/.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
and deployed under [this address](https://saezlab.github.io/saezlab.org-next/).
The site uses the [Astro framework](https://astro.build/) with
[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) integration.

This stuff is very easy to work with, I encourage everyone to play around with
it and contribute to the design of our new page.
